            focusing on block style information architecture,you can create refreshing and 
            engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful phtotgraphy,that act as continum,
            ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page</p></span>

                Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and

            <span class = " mobile">Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It’s
                now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping.
                Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,
                providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.</span>

            <span class = "Parallax">Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor
                website browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their
                message and vision into one dynamic web design page.</span>

            <span class = "Scroll">These days, scrolling is so simple that it’s become an
                instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page
                requires thought and motivation. A single page website
                allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker,
                than needing to sift through multiple pages.</span>

            <span class = "problem">One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that
                they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of
                pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and
                negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results
                page (SERP). Luckily there are ways around this.</span>
